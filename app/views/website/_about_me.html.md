### About me

I live in East London, I've been dancing Lindy since late 2009, and it's a
big part of my life.

I dance all over town - mainly [Lindy Hop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop)
and [Solo Jazz](https://www.herrang.com/disciplines/authentic-jazz).

I admin a few Facebook groups on topics which interest me:

- ["I don't want dancing to f**k my knees/back/ankles"](https://www.facebook.com/groups/387194701353549/)
- [Lindy Hop Web Developers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1410291292585624)
- [1920s Partner Charleston in London](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_187534864606727&ap=1)
- [Gender roles in Lindy Hop](https://www.facebook.com/groups/164917626892715/)
- [Swing Dance Listings site creators and administrators](https://www.facebook.com/groups/474063622636853/)
