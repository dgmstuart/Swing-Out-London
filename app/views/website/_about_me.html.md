### About me

I live in South London, I've been dancing Lindy since late 2009, and I love it. 

I dance all over town and I've tried to have lessons from each of the London swing schools. I mainly dance [Lindy Hop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop) and [Solo Jazz](http://uptownswing.co.uk/authentic-jazz/) as well as a little [Blues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_dance#Blues_dancing_in_the_contemporary_swing_dance_community) when the music demands it. I haven't really learned any [Balboa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balboa_(dance)) yet, but it's on the list.

I'm very keen on 1920's style Charleston - partly because a Lot of the small combo bands who play for dancers play in a Trad/Dixie style which is well suited to Charleston. I administrate a [1920's Partner Charleston group on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_187534864606727&ap=1) to try and encourage more teaching.
