### Swing Music
 
"Swing Music" is a very broad term.
 
A very strict definition might refer to a specific time period from the early 1930's to the late 40's. 
 
A broad definition might span the 20th Century: from the Ragtime of the first two decades, 
through the smooth swing and crooners of the 50's and 60's to the 'neo-swing' of the 1980's and 90's 
and the Electro Swing of today, picking up Gypsy Swing and Western Swing along the way.
 
This policy specifies a certain set of music which generally suits a certain kind of dancing 
and is not an attempt to define what is and isn't Swing music.
