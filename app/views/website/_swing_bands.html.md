### Live Music

We're incredibly lucky in London to share a home with a thriving live trad jazz and Swing music scene including bands like 
[The Shirt Tail Stompers](http://shirttailstompers.com/),
[The London Dance Orchestra](http://londondanceorchestra.co.uk/),
[Benoit Viellefon & his Orchestra](http://www.benoitandhisorchestra.com) and 
[Top Shelf Jazz](http://www.topshelfjazz.co.uk/).

While these bands do sometimes play specifically for dancers, you'll also find them at straight gigs. 
While you'll often find dancers at these it's sometimes wise to Bring Your Own to be sure of getting a dance.
