	<h3 class="section_heading">What is Lindy Hop?</h3>
	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop" title="Wikipedia - Lindy Hop">The Lindy Hop</a> is a fun and dynamic swing dance of the 1930's and 40's, mainly danced to Big Band Swing and Hot Jazz.</p>
	<p>Here are some YouTube clips to give you an idea:</p>

	<h1 id="listings_policy_header" class="section_heading">Listings Policy</h1>
    <p>Here's what you can expect to be listed on Swing Out London:</p>
    <ul id="listings_policy">  
        <li>
            <h3>20s-40's Dance styles </h3>
            <p>The focus is on <%= link_to "Lindy Hop", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop" %> (6 &amp; 8 count and 30's Charleston) but 
                <%= link_to "Blues", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_dance#Blues_dancing_in_the_contemporary_swing_dance_community" %>,
                <%= link_to "Balboa", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balboa_(dance)"%>,
                <%= link_to "Shag", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_shag"%>, 
                and 
                <%= link_to "1920's Charleston", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston_(dance)"%> are also listed since many Lindyhoppers also dance these styles. 
            </p>
            <p>Any nights which are primarily 50's Jive or Rock and Roll are out, as are modern jive, west coast swing and anything of that sort.</p>
            <p> The world seems to Love <%= link_to "Electro Swing", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroswing" %> at the moment, but I don't, so it's out. If you're really interested, there's a regular night at <%= link_to "The Book Club", "http://www.wearetbc.com/" %> in Shoreditch.</p>
        </li>   
        <li>
            <h3>Only in London </h3>
            <p>Listings are only for events on the core London transport network (i.e. places you can easily get a night bus home from!).</p>
        </li>   
        <li>
            <h3>Regular classes...</h3>
            <p>I try and list all of the weekly drop-in classes and all the courses which take place over a number of weeks but repeat regularly.</p>
        </li>   
        <li>
            <h3>...but not workshops</h3>
            <p>There are also many one-off workshops and classes going on in London, but keeping track of those is much more than I can handle: try the websites of the individual swing schools to find out about these.</p>
    
            <p>I will however tweet about anything particularly interesting coming up (especially <%= link_to "aerials", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_(dance_move)"%> workshops) on the <%= link_to "Swing Out London twitter feed", "http://twitter.com/swingoutlondon", :title => "Swing Out London on Twitter"%>.</p>
            
            <p>For more substantial weekend camps and exchanges in the UK and Europe, look no further than the excellent <%= link_to "Swing Events", "http://swingevents.co.uk/"%>, run by a London dancer.</p>
        </li>   
        <li>
            <h3>All social dancing...</h3>
            <p>I try and list all of the opportunities for dancing Lindy Hop in London over the next 14 days and the main nights for related styles.</p> 
        </li>   
        <li>    
            <p>The exceptions are smaller venues like <%= link_to "The Swan at The Globe", "http://www.swanattheglobe.co.uk/#/newscontact/events/"%> and <%= link_to "The Quecumbar", "http://www.quecumbar.co.uk/"%>: while they put on great Swing bands, they can only accommodate a handful of dancers at best and aren't really suitable for <%= link_to "lindy-bombing", "http://wikibin.org/articles/lindy-bombing.html"%>.</p>
        </li>   
        <li>
            <h3>...including vintage clubs</h3>
            <p>I Love getting dressed up in vintage attire and going out to a club like <%= link_to "the Blitz party", "http://www.theblitzparty.com"%>, <%= link_to "the Candlelight club", "www.thecandlelightclub.com/"%> or <%= link_to "Die Freche Muse", "http://www.diefrechemuse.co.uk/"%>, where the (often live) music is swinging and everyone looks fabulous. These nights aren't aimed at dancers, but if you Bring Your Own there's often a great time to be had, as well as a crowd of admiring Civilians (non-dancers).</p>
        </li>   
        <li>
            <h3>...and swing gigs</h3>
            <p>London has a solid bunch of trad jazz and swing bands like <%= link_to "The Shirt Tail Stompers", "http://shirttailstompers.com/"%>, <%= link_to "Benoit Viellefon & his Orchestra", "http://www.benoitandhisorchestra.com"%>, <%= link_to "Top Shelf Jazz", "http://www.topshelfjazz.co.uk/"%> and <%= link_to "The Sax Pastilles", "http://www.saxpastilles.co.uk/"%>, all playing great dancing music. You'll see them around town playing Lindy socials, but they also sometimes play straight gigs where there is room to dance. Again it's usually a case of <abbr title="Bring Your Own">BYO</abbr> dancers.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
