About Swing Out London
======================
This website is mainly for [Me](/#about_me). 
There - I've said it: it presents the information I want to see, the way I want to see it and
it's my main way of personally deciding where I want to dance. 
If it's useful to other people as well, then I'm very glad.

We are incredibly privileged in London to have such a great range of opportunities for dancing available to us.
The problem is finding out about those opportunities.

Motivation
----------
I was frustrated when starting out that I couldn't find any comprehensive Lindy Hop listings 
and although I later found out about existing services like 
[Swing Junction](http://www.swingjunction.co.uk/modules/piCal/index.php?cid=1),
[Swing Dancers Of London](http://www.swingdancersoflondon.org/) 
and Judy's List (a regular email - ask an experienced dancer)
they don't provide exactly what I want, so I decided to make my own site (as you do).

In some respects London is quite a divided scene with a lot of dancers unaware of what's going on outside the 
bubble of the first swing school they came across.

I think that independent and community-founded organisations like
[Swing Dancers Of London](http://www.swingdancersoflondon.org/),
[Swing Events](http://swingevents.co.uk/) 
and the [London Lindy Exchange](http://londonlindyexchange.com/)
are really important and I want to follow in their footsteps by providing 
a great service independently of any of the swing schools.

Swing Out London has been live since August 2010.

Principles
--------
There are a number of principles which I try and stick to in running this site which
I think are important to delivering a useful service. Swing Out London is:

1.  
    ### Clear

    I aim to make it quick and easy to decide where you want to learn and dance,
    by providing all the information you need to make that decision up front 
    and then passing you on to an external website which has more detail.
    
2.  
    ### Comprehensive

    I aim to cover every regular class going on in the capital and I've got my ear to the ground -
    seeking out social dancing opportunities you won't hear about anywhere else.
    
3.  
    ### Not just dance socials
    
    Swing Out London attempts to list _all_ the social dancing opportunities in town. 
    With the recent burst of interest in Vintage in London there are a number of vintage-themed events like
    [the Blitz party](http://www.theblitzparty.com"),
    [the Candlelight club](www.thecandlelightclub.com/) and
    [Die Freche Muse](http://www.diefrechemuse.co.uk/)
    which are not aimed at swing dancers, but which play suitable music.
    
    These nights aren't to everyone's taste and you shouldn't expect to find dancers there, 
    but if you Bring Your Own there's often a fun evening to be had.
    The same applies to swing gigs.

4.  
    ### Up-to-Date

    I'm wired into all of the mailing lists, Facebook groups and Twitter feeds,
    so if something gets cancelled, or something new comes up, you'll be the first to know.
    On other listings sites you'll still find long-dead dance events, but not here.

5.  
    ### Independent

    At the moment I'm just listing everything I can find, so there's no scope for bias towards any swing school
    or promoter, but I hope to expand the scope of the site in future, so I want to lay out my colours up front:
    obviously I have my preferences of lessons and social nights, but you should never see any of that 
    preference on the site.

6.  
    ### Sexy

    Whatever you think of the other listings sites, you'd have a hard time arguing that they were pretty. 
    I do my best to make sure that the site is attractive and easy to read.
