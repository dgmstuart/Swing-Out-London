	<h3 class="section_heading">About me</h3>
	<p>I live in South London, I've been dancing Lindy since late 2009, and I love it.</p>
	<p>I have a blog called "<%= link_to "Why I Dance...", "http://whyidance.tumblr.com/"%>" which does exactly what it says on the tin.</p>
	<p>Leads in London don't get to meet and talk to each other so much, so I organise <%= link_to "London Lindy Leads Dinners", "http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_147221981989905"%> to try and fix that.</p>
	<p>I dance all over town and I've tried to have lessons from each of the London swing schools. I mainly dance <%= link_to "Lindy Hop", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop" %> (6 &amp; 8 count and 30's Charleston) and a little <%= link_to "Blues", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_dance#Blues_dancing_in_the_contemporary_swing_dance_community" %>.</p>
	<p>I'm keen to learn more 1920's style Charleston, and I've started a <%=link_to "1920's Partner Charleston revolution","http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_187534864606727&ap=1"%> to try and encourage more teaching in this area.</p>

	<h1 class="section_heading">About Swing Out London</h1>

    <p>This website is mainly for <%= link_to "Me", {:anchor => "about_me"}, {:rel =>"subsection"} %>. There - I've said it: it presents the information I want to see, the way I want to see it and it's my main way of personally deciding where I want to dance. If it's useful to other people as well, then I'm very glad.</p>

    <p>We are incredibly privileged in London to have such a great range of opportunities for dancing available to us. The problem is finding out about those opportunities.</p>
    
    <h2 class="section_heading" id="motivation_header">Motivation</h2>
    <p>I was frustrated when starting out that I couldn't find any comprehensive Lindy Hop listings and although I later found out about existing services like <%= link_to "Swing Junction", "http://www.swingjunction.co.uk/modules/piCal/index.php?cid=1"%> , <%= link_to "Swing Dancers Of London", "http://www.swingdancersoflondon.org/"%> and Judy's List (a regular email - ask an experienced dancer) they don't provide exactly what I want, so I decided to make my own site (as you do).</p>

    <p>In some respects London is quite a divided scene with a lot of dancers unaware of what's going on outside the bubble of the first swing school they came across.</p>
	
	<p>I think that independent and community-founded organisations like <%= link_to "Swing Dancers Of London", "http://www.swingdancersoflondon.org/"%>, <%= link_to "Swing Events", "http://swingevents.co.uk/"%> and the <%= link_to "London Lindy Exchange", "http://londonlindyexchange.com/ "%> are really important and I want to follow in their footsteps by providing a great service independently of any of the swing schools. </p>
	
	<p>Swing Out London has been live since August 2010.</p>

    <h2 class="section_heading">Principles</h2>
    <p>There are a number of principles which I try and stick to in running this site which I think are important to delivering a useful service. Swing Out London is:</p>
    
    <ol id="principles">
        <li>
            <h3>Clear</h3>
            <p>I aim to make it quick and easy to decide where you want to <%= link_to "Learn", :action => "index", :anchor => "classes_today" %> and <%= link_to "Dance", :action => "index", :anchor => "socials_today" %>, by providing all the information you need to make that decision up front and then passing you on to an external website which has more detail.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Comprehensive</h3>
            <p>I aim to cover every regular class going on in the capital and I've got my ear to the ground - seeking out social dancing opportunities you won't hear about anywhere else.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Up-to-Date</h3>
            <p>I'm wired into all of the mailing lists, Facebook groups and Twitter feeds, so if something gets cancelled, or something new comes up, you'll be the first to know. On other listings sites you'll still find long-dead dance events, but not here.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Independent</h3>
            <p>At the moment I'm just listing everything I can find, so there's no scope for bias towards any swing school or promoter, but I hope to expand the scope of the site in future, so I want to lay out my colours up front: obviously I have my preferences of lessons and social nights, but you should never see any of that preference on the site.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Sexy</h3>
            <p>Whatever you think of the other listings sites, you'd have a hard time arguing that they were pretty. I do my best to make sure that the site is attractive and easy to read.</p>
        </li>
  
    </ol>

    	<ul>
    		<li>The styling of the site was inspired by vintage playbills, magazine listings and event posters. The primary font used is <%= link_to "Futura", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)", :title=>"Wikipedia - Futura" %> (falling back to Trebuchet MS on Windows) which was designed in 1927.</li>
    		<li>The <%= link_to "vintage wallpaper", "http://zebiii.deviantart.com/art/Patterns-2-94330934", :title => "Patterns.2 by ZeBii on DeviantArt"%> in the background is by <%= link_to "ZeBii on DeviantArt", "http://zebiii.deviantart.com/" %>.</li>
    		<li>This site was written on a Mac, mainly using <%= link_to "TextMate", "http://macromates.com/" %> and <%= link_to "Firefox", "http://www.firefox.com", :title => "Firefox web browser" %> with the following plugins:	

    			<ul class="textlist">
    				<li><a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> with <a href="http://tools.sitepoint.com/codeburner/" title="CodeBurner - Reference Tool for Web Developers">Code Burner</a>;</li>
    				<li>The <%= link_to "Web Developer", "http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/"%> toolbar;</li>

    			</ul>

    		</li>
    		<li><a href="http://www.codestyle.org/servlets/FontStack">CodeStyle's Font Stack Builder</a> and <a href="http://www.identifont.com/similar.html">Identifont</a> came in handy for picking fonts.</li>
    		
    		<li>The site sits on a custom-built <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, which I wrote from scratch. I use <%= link_to "Git", "http://git-scm.com/" %> for version control and there is <a href = "https://github.com/leveretweb/Swing-Out-London">a public <%=content_tag :abbr, 'repo', :title=>'repository'%> for Swing Out London on github</a>.</li>
    		<li>The site is currently hosted on <%= link_to "Heroku", "http://heroku.com/"%>.</li>
    		
    		<li>I read <%=link_to "A List Apart", "http://www.alistapart.com/"%> and <%=link_to ".net magazine", "http://www.netmag.co.uk/"%> and I'm sold on <%= link_to "web standards", "http://www.w3schools.com/site/site_standards.asp" %>.</li>
    		<li><a id="validation_failures">Unfortunately the code of the site doesn't quite validate on all pages</a>. The <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> uses <%= link_to "CSS3 media selectors", "http://www.css3.info/preview/media-queries/"%> and the HTML on the homepage uses a <%=link_to "Facebook 'like' button", "http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like"%> which uses a custom xml namespace which (according to my current understanding) the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" title="The W3C Markup Validation Service">W3C validator</a> doesn't recognise. Hopefully at some point I'll get these to validate, but it's not high on my priority list.</li>
