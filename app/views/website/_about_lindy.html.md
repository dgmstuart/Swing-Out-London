### Help! I'm new here: what's this "Lindy Hop" thing all about?

The [Lindy Hop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop "Wikipedia - Lindy Hop") is a fun and dynamic swing dance which became popular in the USA in the 1930's and 40's. It is mainly danced to Big Band Swing and Hot Jazz.

Cast from your mind images of girls being thrown around - that's just for jams and competitions. Lindy Hop is primarily a social dance.

Here are some YouTube clips to give you an idea:
